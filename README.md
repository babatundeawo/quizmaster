## About

QuizMaster is a free quiz game for curious players of all ages. Pick a topic and a difficulty level, answer before the timer runs out, and see how your score compares on the online leaderboard. Players can also write their own questions for everyone to enjoy.

## Features

- **400 questions** in four topics: Science, Geography, Maths and Technology, with easy, medium and hard levels
- **Countdown timer** and instant feedback on every answer
- **Online leaderboard** with a separate top 10 for each difficulty level
- **Create your own questions**, shared with every player
- **Player profiles** with a nickname, best score and games played
- **Light and dark themes** that follow your device
- **Works on phones and computers**, and installs like an app
- **Plays offline** with the built-in questions once it has been opened online
- **Keyboard friendly**: answer with the keys 1 to 4 or A to D

## How to use it

1. **Open the game** and choose **Play as guest** or **Continue with Google**. Guest accounts stay in one browser; Google keeps your scores on every device.
2. **Choose a nickname.** Please use a nickname, not your real name.
3. **Start a quiz.** Pick a topic and a difficulty level, then press **Begin quiz**. Each game has up to 10 questions.
4. **Answer before the ring runs out.** Tap an answer, or press 1 to 4 on a keyboard.
5. **See your result** and open the **Leaderboard**. Use the tabs to compare scores at the Easy, Medium, Hard and Mixed levels.
6. **Create questions** from the Create tab. Your questions appear for all players.

### Install on a phone

- **Android (Chrome):** open the game, tap the three-dot menu, then **Install app**.
- **iPhone (Safari):** open the game, tap **Share**, then **Add to Home Screen**.

## Tech stack

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no framework and no build tools for the app itself
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Authentication and Firestore for players, questions and scores
- A web app manifest and a service worker, so the game installs and works offline
- GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages for automatic checks and publishing
