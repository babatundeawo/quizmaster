# Customizing QuizMaster

Every change below can be made on the GitHub website: open the file, click the **pencil icon**, edit, then **Commit changes**. The site updates by itself after a minute or two (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)).

## Colours

Open **`css/tokens.css`**.

- `--color-primary` is the main purple. Change it and buttons, links and highlights follow.
- `--gradient-brand` is the purple gradient on big buttons and the home card.
- `--color-accent` is the amber used for the score pill and the logo tail.
- The block starting `[data-theme="dark"]` holds the dark theme colours.

Keep text readable: dark text on light backgrounds, light text on dark backgrounds. A free checker such as the WebAIM contrast checker helps.

## Fonts

1. In **`index.html`** (and `privacy.html`, `404.html`) find the line that starts `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?...` and change the font names in it.
2. In **`css/tokens.css`** change `--font-display` (headings) and `--font-body` (text) to the same names.

Use fonts that are free for commercial use, and add credit for them in the README under **Credits** when the licence asks for it.

## Text and wording

- Game screens, headings and button labels: **`index.html`**.
- Messages that appear while playing (results, errors): **`js/app.js`**.
- Privacy summary: **`privacy.html`**.
- Page title and description for search engines: the `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` near the top of **`index.html`**.

## Questions

Built-in questions are in **`js/questions.js`**. See the example in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#add-or-fix-a-question). Players' own questions are stored online and are not in this file.

## Game settings

At the top of **`js/app.js`**:

| Setting | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `TIME_PER_QUESTION` | Seconds for each question (default 15) |
| `MAX_QUESTIONS` | Questions in one game (default 10) |
| `MIN_QUESTIONS_FOR_LEADERBOARD` | Shortest game that counts for the leaderboard (default 5) |

If you change `MAX_QUESTIONS` or `MIN_QUESTIONS_FOR_LEADERBOARD`, also change the matching numbers (`5` and `10`) in the `scores` part of **`firestore.rules`**, then publish the rules again in Firebase (FIREBASE_LOGIN_SETUP.md, part 6). Otherwise scores will be refused.

## Images and icons

All pictures are in **`assets/images/`**.

| File | Size | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `icons/icon-192.png` and `icons/icon-512.png` | 192 and 512 pixels, square | The installed app icon |
| `icons/icon-maskable-512.png` | 512 pixels, mark kept in the middle 60% | Android icons that are cropped to a shape |
| `icons/apple-touch-icon.png` | 180 pixels, square | iPhone home screen |
| `icons/favicon.svg`, `favicon-32.png`, `favicon.ico` | | Browser tab |
| `og-image.png` | 1200 x 630 pixels | The picture shown when the link is shared |

To replace a file: open its folder on GitHub, click **Add file > Upload files**, upload a file **with the same name**, and commit. After changing icons, change `quizmaster-v3` to `quizmaster-v4` in `service-worker.js` so phones fetch the new ones.

## README pictures

The screenshots in `docs/assets/` were taken before the site was published. After your site is live you can replace `screenshot-landing.png`, `screenshot-setup.png` and `screenshot-quiz.png` with fresh screenshots (same file names).
